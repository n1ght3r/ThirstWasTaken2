/*
 * The tasks every node shares, whatever mod loader it builds for: the Java toolchain, the seam
 * checks, what never belongs in a jar, and the task that collects the jars.
 *
 * Applied by `build.gradle.kts` (the Fabric nodes), `build.neoforge.gradle.kts` and
 * `build.forge.gradle.kts`. Each of
 * those sets three extra properties first: `thirst.requiredJava`, because the Java version a node
 * needs follows from its Minecraft version and only the node's own script can read that, and
 * `thirst.integrations` and `thirst.loaderIndependentIntegrations`, from the integration table in
 * build-logic. A script applied with `apply(from)` cannot see build-logic's classes, so it is handed
 * what it needs as plain lists.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately not here:
 *
 * - **The source directory wiring.** Loom splits `main` and `client`; ModDevGradle has no split, so
 *   the NeoForge node compiles the client sources into `main`. The two scripts wire their source
 *   sets differently on purpose, as build.neoforge.gradle.kts explains. Which directories an
 *   integration adds is the table's to say, in build-logic; each script makes the calls itself.
 * - **What `buildAndCollect` copies.** The jar a node ships is Loom's remapped jar on Fabric and the
 *   plain `jar` on NeoForge, so each script adds its own inputs to the task registered below.

/**
 * Fails when a class the game loads whether or not an optional mod is installed names that mod.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** 1.0.9 crashed every NeoForge client without Sophisticated Core, from an
 * entrypoint that asked the gate first. The JVM verifies a class whole when it links it, before any
 * code in it runs, and verifying the entrypoint's tab factories loaded a class whose superclass is
 * Sophisticated's. No run could see it: runClient always has every optional mod, and runServer and
 * runGametest never load a client entrypoint. This reads the compiled classes, so a lambda or a
 * generic argument counts the same as an import.
 *
 * **What is always loaded**, the roots: every entrypoint in `fabric.mod.json`, every class carrying
 * `@Mod`, `@EventBusSubscriber`, this mod's `@IntegrationEntrypoint` or Jade's `@WailaPlugin`, and
 * every mixin config's plugin. A root may name Minecraft, the JDK, the loaders, the libraries every
 * game ships and this mod's own classes. An entrypoint another mod reads, `jade` or `modmenu`, may also name that mod, since only it loads the
 * class.
 *
 * **What a root must not do**, the two ways 1.0.9 could have happened:
 *
 * - name another mod's class anywhere, even in code a gate keeps from running;
 * - name one of this mod's own classes in a way the verifier resolves (a descriptor, a cast, a
 *   supertype) when that class, or a supertype of it, is another mod's. Calling a static method on
 *   such a class is fine, and is exactly how a gate hands over: the class is only loaded when the call
 *   runs. `DrinkingUpgradeTabs` is that shape.
 *
 * It also fails when core code, `src/main/java` and `src/client/java` and the loader directories, refers
 * to an integration package at all, since those are only compiled on some nodes and name other mods.
 * The packages are every row of the integration table, so a new integration is covered by its row.
