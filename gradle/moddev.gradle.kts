/*
 * What the two ModDevGradle scripts share: build.neoforge.gradle.kts (the NeoForge nodes) and
 * build.forge.gradle.kts (the Forge node), both on the same `moddev-gradle` artifact. Their source sets,
 * mods and runs, the dev tools and the watchdog, the resource translation and its check, and the tasks
 * around Minecraft's artifacts are here once. What each loader does differently stays in its own script:
 * the loader version, the fluid API directories, the dependencies and how they are remapped, the mixin
 * wiring Forge 47 needs, the manifest's expansions and the jar `buildAndCollect` ships.
 *
 * Each script applies this right after its `neoForge { }` or `legacyForge { }` block sets the version,
 * and before anything that names a source set below; gradle/shared.gradle.kts comes later, as on Fabric.
 * A script applied with `apply(from)` sees ModDevGradle, which settings.gradle.kts resolves, but not
 * build-logic or Stonecutter, so the applying script hands over what it reads from them as extra
 * properties, all set before the `apply`:
 *
 * | Property                            | What                                                                      |
 * |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `thirst.loader`                     | the loader's source directory name, `neoforge` or `forge`                 |
 * | `thirst.loaderName`                 | its name in task names and messages, `NeoForge` or `Forge`                |
 * | `thirst.manifest`                   | the mods.toml the integrations are appended to                            |
 * | `thirst.minecraft`                  | the node's Minecraft version, Stonecutter's `sc.current.version`          |
 * | `thirst.clientSources`              | where this node's preprocessed `src/client` is                            |
 * | `thirst.gametestReportOption`       | whether the gametest server takes `--report` (1.21.5 on)                  |
 * | `thirst.flightRecorder`             | the JVM arguments `-Pprofile` adds to runBenchmark, from build-logic      |
 * | `thirst.integrationManifest`        | the text the node's integrations append to the manifest, or ""           |
 * | `thirst.integrationInputs`          | each integration this loader has, by directory, to its deps value or ""  |
 * | `thirst.translateJson`              | `(json, file) -> json`, build-logic's translator for this loader          |
 * | `thirst.devRunProgramArguments`     | program arguments for the runs that load the dev tools                    |
