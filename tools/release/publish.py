"""Publishes one release of ThirstWasTaken2 to Modrinth, and holds what `publish_curseforge.py` shares.

A release is one file per node, each Minecraft version on each of its loaders (Fabric, NeoForge and, on
1.20.1, Forge), each with its own jar, its own list of Minecraft releases and its own list of optional
mods. Done by hand in a web form that is a dozen chances to attach the wrong jar or forget a game version,
and nothing afterwards would say so. Everything a
release needs is already written down in the repository, so it is read rather than retyped:

- the version number and every node from `stonecutter.properties.toml`, the file the build and CI read
  too, so a node added there is released without touching this script;
- the Minecraft releases an upload claims, from that node's `mod.mc_releases`;
- the mods to list, from the `deps.*` keys the node resolves, so a dependency dropped from a node stops
  being listed for it;
- the release notes, from the matching section of `CHANGELOG.md`;
- the project page's description, from `docs/MODRINTH.md` (and `docs/CURSEFORGE.md` on CurseForge).

    python tools/release/publish.py --dry-run               # print every upload, send nothing
    python tools/release/publish.py                         # build, then upload to Modrinth
    python tools/release/publish.py --no-build              # publish the jars already in build/libs
    python tools/release/publish.py --only 26.2.x-neoforge  # one node only
    python tools/release/publish.py --description-only      # update the project page, upload nothing
    python tools/release/publish.py --update-dependencies   # fix the mods published files list

`publish_curseforge.py` takes the same flags and uploads the same jars to CurseForge; run it with
`--no-build` after this one, since this one has just built them.

Before running it: bump `mod.version` in `stonecutter.properties.toml` (the one place the version is
written), write the `## [<version>]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` in the style of the `write-docs` skill,
run `python .github/scripts/update_mc_deps.py --check`, work through `docs/dev/MANUAL-TESTING.md`, and
commit. Modrinth and CurseForge are the only places a release is published: there is no tag and no
GitHub release.

The token comes from `MODRINTH_TOKEN` in the environment or in `.env`, which is git-ignored; it needs
Modrinth's create-version scope, and the write-projects scope to update the description.

After the uploads the project page's description is compared with `docs/MODRINTH.md` and replaced when
they differ, so the page follows the file the way the files follow `CHANGELOG.md`. `--dry-run` only
says whether it would. A token without the write-projects scope leaves the description as it is and
says so; the uploads before it still count. CurseForge has no API for the description at all, so
`publish_curseforge.py` can only say where to paste `docs/CURSEFORGE.md` by hand.

Re-running is safe, and is how a half-finished release is finished: a version already on Modrinth is
skipped by its version number. Nothing already published is overwritten: a bad upload is deleted on
Modrinth by hand, then re-run here.

Standard library only, like the rest of the Python in this repository.
