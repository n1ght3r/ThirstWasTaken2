## Drinking Upgrade

Drinks from the backpack when the thirst bar is low, the way the Feeding Upgrade eats.

- Drinks water bottles, waterskins, water bowls, other drinks that restore thirst, and water from a
  Tank Upgrade in the same backpack.
- The cleanest water goes first. Salt water is never drunk.
- Other drinks come after water. Potions other than water, milk and ominous bottles are left alone.
- Empty bottles and bowls go back into the backpack.
- The filter slots limit which items it drinks.
- In a placed Sophisticated Storage block, it serves players within three blocks.

The Upgrade Base of Sophisticated Storage works too. The recipe unlocks once an Upgrade Base is picked
up.

### Advanced Drinking Upgrade

Made from a Drinking Upgrade, a diamond, two gold ingots and three redstone. It has more filter slots
and two buttons:

| Button | Choices |
|---|---|
| When to drink | As soon as a little thirsty, once half the drink fits, or only when the whole drink fits |
| Lowest grade | Dirty, Murky, Clean or Pure. Left click to go up, right click to go down |

The basic upgrade drinks once half the drink fits, and only Clean water or better.

## Water grades in upgrades

- The Tank Upgrade keeps the grade of the water poured in, and fills bottles, buckets, waterskins and
  bowls with that grade.
- The Pump Upgrade grades water from the world like a bottle would. Sea water stays salt water.
- Water of different grades does not mix in one tank.
- The Feeding and Alchemy Upgrades restore thirst for what they feed. The Alchemy Upgrade never drinks
  plain water.
- The Smelting and Smoking Upgrades clean water like a furnace or a smoker.
