# Let's Do: Candlelight integration plan

What ThirstWasTaken2 should do with [Let's Do: Candlelight - Farm&Charm compat](https://modrinth.com/mod/lets-do-candlelight-farmcharm-compat)
(mod id `candlelight`, package `net.satisfy.candlelight`), the kitchen and dining addon of the Let's Do
collection: furniture, stoves, kitchen sinks, a large cooking pot, a cooking pan and restaurant dishes.
It **requires Farm & Charm** and runs on Farm & Charm's machines and recipe types, so this plan builds on
[FARM-AND-CHARM-INTEGRATION.md](FARM-AND-CHARM-INTEGRATION.md) and does nothing until that one's step 1
is done. Once the work is built, how it works goes where the steps below say.

Written on 2026-10-01 from:

- the repository [Let-s-Do-Collection/Candlelight](https://github.com/Let-s-Do-Collection/Candlelight),
  branch `1.21.1` at `c750a9e` (2026-09-19), which is the released `2.1.13`, built against Farm & Charm
  `1.1.20`;
- the Modrinth project `qwbArkQk`.

## Which build for which node

**Only the two 1.21.1 nodes**, as for Farm & Charm. The 1.20.1 line stopped at `2.0.5` (2025-08-05,
Fabric and Quilt only) and is not updated any more, so `1.20.1` and `1.20.1-forge` are left out on
purpose. There is no build newer than 1.21.1.

| Node | Build | Modrinth id | Requires on `runClient` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1.21.1` | `2.1.13` Fabric | `DEKqjSw9` | Farm & Charm, Architectury API, Cloth Config: all already there after Farm & Charm's step 1 |
| `1.21.1-neoforge` | `2.1.13` NeoForge | `Cxu0FvZB` | Farm & Charm, Architectury API |
| every other node | none | — | — |

## What Candlelight is, for water

Candlelight has **no water logic of its own**. Every water path in it is a Farm & Charm class that
Candlelight registers or reuses:

| Candlelight block | Its class | What it means for us |
|---|---|---|
| **Kitchen sinks**, eleven of them (`cobblestone_`, `sandstone_`, `stone_bricks_`, `deepslate_`, `granite_`, `end_`, `mud_`, `quartz_`, `red_nether_bricks_`, `basalt_`, `bamboo_kitchen_sink`) | Farm & Charm's `SinkBlock` | the one block Farm & Charm itself leaves unregistered. See below: **an endless source of Clean water from nothing** |
| Stoves (one per stone, and bamboo) | `CStoveBlock extends` Farm & Charm's `StoveBlock` | Farm & Charm's `stove` recipes; covered by Farm & Charm's step 6 |
| `cooking_pot` (Large Cooking Pot) | its own `LargeCookingPotBlockEntity`, running Farm & Charm's `pot_cooking` recipes (`CookingPotRecipe`) | the same recipes and matcher as Farm & Charm's pot; covered by Farm & Charm's step 6 |
| `cooking_pan` | its own `CookingPanBlockEntity`, running Farm & Charm's `roaster` recipes | no water in any of them |

Candlelight's own recipes add to Farm & Charm's types (7 pot, 7 roaster, 7 stove, 7 crafting bowl).
**Only one takes water**: `mozzarella` in the Crafting Bowl, milk plus `#candlelight:water_bottles`
(`#c:water_bottles` and `minecraft:water_bucket`, so again the bucket only). Mozzarella is not a drink.

### The kitchen sink

Farm & Charm's `SinkBlock.useItemOn`, a two-block block with one `FILLED` boolean:

| Click on an empty sink with | Result |
|---|---|
| an **empty hand** | the sink fills, **from nothing** |
| a water bucket | the sink fills, an empty bucket back |
| a **glass bottle** | the sink fills and the bottle comes back: also from nothing |

| Click on a filled sink with | Result |
|---|---|
| a bucket | `minecraft:water_bucket`, unstamped |
| a glass bottle | a `minecraft:potion` of `Potions.WATER`, unstamped |

So a sink is an endless tap. Today everything it hands out is unstamped, which reads as
`defaultPurity` (Clean by default): **a Candlelight kitchen makes purifying water pointless.** It also
launders: a Dirty or salty bucket poured in comes back Clean. Both are worse than the Farm & Charm
trough, because the sink needs no water at all to start with.

## The drinks and foods

Candlelight has **no drinks**: its `wine_glass` is empty glassware, and the wine in its dish names
comes from other Let's Do mods (Vinery), which are not part of this plan. Only a few of its dishes are
wet enough to count. In `ThirstConfig` by id, a `candlelightFoods` merged with `putMissing`, like the
other addons. Proposed (thirst, quenched):

| Group | Items | Proposed |
|---|---|---|
| Soups, a bowl | `tomato_soup`, `mushroom_soup` | 4, 5, as Farmer's Delight's soups and Farm & Charm's |
| Salads, a bowl | `salad`, `beetroot_salad` | 4, 5, as Farmer's Delight's mixed salad |
| | `fresh_garden_salad` (a tray of four servings when placed) | 4, 5 per serving, if eating from the placed tray goes through the item; see step 3 |
| | `tomato_mozzarella_salad` | 3, 4 |
| Dessert | `chocolate_mousse` | 2, 3, as Farmer's Delight's glow berry custard |
| Left out | `mozzarella`, the pastas, `lasagne`, `bolognese`, roasts, steaks, `beef_wellington`, `pork_ribs`, `khinkali`, `chicken_teriyaki`, `omelet`, `tropical_fish_supreme`, the wine-cooked dishes (the wine is cooked off) | — |

The ids come from Candlelight's `ObjectRegistry`. Step 3 confirms each one resolves.

## Status

| # | Item | Kind | Nodes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The mod on the `runClient` classpath | build | both 1.21.1 | **Done** (2026-10-01) |
| 2 | Thirst values for the dishes | data | all (config) | **Done** (2026-10-01), values as proposed |
| 3 | What happens to a grade at a sink, in game | investigation | both 1.21.1 | **Done** (2026-10-01) |
| 4 | The kitchen sink stops being a free Clean tap | decision, then code | both 1.21.1 | **Decided** (2026-10-01): (a), and **done** |
| 5 | Sea water and Candlelight's pot, stove and bowl | code | both 1.21.1 | **Done** (2026-10-01), with its own target |
| 6 | Nothing crashes without the mod | test | both 1.21.1 | **Done** (2026-10-01) |
| 7 | Changelog, player docs, store pages | docs | — | **Done** (2026-10-01) |

How it works now is in [src/main/farmandcharm/AGENTS.md](../../../src/main/farmandcharm/AGENTS.md).

## 1. The mod on the `runClient` classpath (done)

`deps.candlelight` beside Farm & Charm's keys, pinned by Modrinth id, in `MODRINTH_DEPS`, and one
`runClientMod` line in each loader script. No row in the integration table and no directory of its
own: the code is in `src/main/farmandcharm`. Candlelight `2.1.13` runs with Farm & Charm `1.1.26`,
though it was built against `1.1.20`.

## 2. Thirst values (done)

`candlelightFoods` in `ThirstConfig`, checked by `farmAndCharmDrinksAreMergedIntoAnOlderConfig` beside
Farm & Charm's. `fresh_garden_salad` is eaten from the hand like the others: from thirst 4 it lands on 8.

## 3. Investigation (done)

In [tools/agent/integrations/farm-and-charm.jsonl](../../../tools/agent/integrations/farm-and-charm.jsonl),
passed whole on both nodes on 2026-10-01:

| Case | Found |
|---|---|
| The eleven sink ids, Candlelight's cooking pot | all exist |
| A salty bucket on an empty sink | refused, the bucket kept |
| An empty hand, then a glass bottle, then a bucket | the sink fills from nothing; the bottle and the bucket are Murky |
| Nettle tea in the Large Cooking Pot, plain and salty bucket | tea from the plain one, nothing from the salty one |
| Tomato soup, fresh garden salad, chocolate mousse from thirst 4 | 8, 8 and 6 |

## 4. Decision: the kitchen sink (done, (a))

`SinkMixin` on Farm & Charm's `SinkBlock`: a salty water bucket is refused at the head of `useItemOn`,
and whatever goes to the player through `Player.addItem` is stamped Murky if it is water, the same
`StandingWater.STANDING` as the trough. The empty-hand fill stays, as Candlelight meant it. The other
options, for the record: (b) a sink that holds only what is poured in, with a grade on its blockstate,
which changes how Candlelight's own block plays; (c) nothing.

## 5. Sea water in Candlelight's cooking (done)

The plan assumed Farm & Charm's step 6 would reach Candlelight through `GeneralUtil.matchesRecipe`. It
does not: the Large Cooking Pot has its own copy of the Cooking Pot's matcher. So
`SeaWaterIngredientMixin` names it as a fourth target, by string, and the plugin skips it when
Candlelight is absent. Candlelight's stoves extend Farm & Charm's and are covered by its target. The
Crafting Bowl's mozzarella is refused too, through Farm & Charm's bowl.

## 6. Optional seam (done)

`tools/agent/smoke/boot.jsonl` with `-PwithoutOptional=candlelight` comes up and stays up on both nodes,
with Farm & Charm still loaded, and so does `-PwithoutOptional=farm-and-charm`, which leaves both out.

## 7. Docs (done)

One site page for both mods, [integrations/farm-and-charm](../../docs/integrations/farm-and-charm.md),
with a picture of a kitchen sink between a stove and counters; a changelog entry of its own; rows in
`docs/docs/installation.md`; Candlelight named in Farm & Charm's row on the Modrinth and CurseForge
pages and in their versions tables.

## Not planned

- **1.20.1, Forge, and any version past 1.21.1.** The 1.20.1 line is no longer updated.
- **Vinery, Bakery, Brewery and the other Let's Do mods**, whose wines, juices and beers are the real
  drinks of the collection. Each is its own plan if wanted.
- **The Cooking Pan.** Roaster recipes take no water.
- **Furniture** (tables, cabinets, the dinner bell): no water.
