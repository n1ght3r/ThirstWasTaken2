# Where sea water is refused

Sea water is `WaterQuality.Salt`. It is a different kind of water, not a low grade of fresh water: it
carries `water_salty: true` and no `water_purity`. This page lists every place that turns it away,
every place that takes it but leaves it salty, and the hanging pot, which takes it and mixes it in.
Checked against the code on 2026-10-01.

A check that keeps sea water out reads `WaterPurity.isSalty(stack)` on a stack,
`WaterPurity.storedQuality(state) == WaterQuality.SALT` on a block, or
`instanceof WaterQuality.Fresh` on a quality it already has.

## Refused: nothing happens

### Core

| What | Where | How |
|---|---|---|
| Boiling a canteen or flask on a campfire | [WaterskinItem.java](../../../src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/item/WaterskinItem.java) `useOn` | The click is spent and the player sees `thirstwastaken2.message.cannot_boil_salt`. The water stays salty |
| Boiling in a hanging pot | [HangingPotBlock.java](../../../src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/block/HangingPotBlock.java) `needsBoiling` | Only fresh water below Pure boils, so sea water sits in the pot unchanged. Gametest `anUnlitCampfireOrSaltWaterDoesNotBoil` |
| Purification recipes: furnace, smoker, campfire, Cooking Pot | [ThirstRecipeProvider.java](../../../src/datagen/java/com/thirstwastaken2/datagen/ThirstRecipeProvider.java) | Every ingredient asks for a `water_purity` and for `water_salty: false`, so sea water matches no recipe |
| Grade in the API | [ThirstApi.java](../../../src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/api/ThirstApi.java) `purity` | Sea water reports `NOT_WATER` to other mods; `isSalt` tells them why |

## Refused by mixing rules, not by salt

Tanks that compare fluid components will not put two kinds of water together. A tank of fresh water
refuses sea water, and a tank of sea water refuses fresh, as two grades refuse each other:
Sophisticated's tanks, Supplementaries' jars and faucet, Brewin' and Chewin's keg, Create's tanks. See
[sophisticated/AGENTS.md](../../../src/main/sophisticated/AGENTS.md) for the measured cases.

## Taken, and kept salty

These take sea water and give it back salty. Nothing here makes it fresh.

| What | Where | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Drinking | [ThirstManager.java](../../../src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/data/ThirstManager.java), [WaterPurity.java](../../../src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/purity/WaterPurity.java) | Can be drunk. Restores nothing, makes the player thirstier, and still counts as a drink |
| Waterskin, canteen, flask | [WaterskinItem.java](../../../src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/item/WaterskinItem.java) | One salty serving poured in turns the whole vessel salty |
| Create Sand Filter (Create, Create on Forge, Create Fly) | `SandFilterBlockEntity`, [createfly/WaterFluids.java](../../../src/main/createfly/java/com/thirstwastaken2/createfly/WaterFluids.java) | Flows through unfiltered: sand does not take salt out |
| Cold Sweat Boiler | [BoiledWater.java](../../../src/main/coldsweat/java/com/thirstwastaken2/coldsweat/BoiledWater.java) (and `coldsweatforge`) | Accepted into a water slot, never raised, and does not keep the Boiler burning |
| Cold Sweat waterskin on a campfire | [CampfireWaterskinMixin.java](../../../src/main/coldsweat/java/com/thirstwastaken2/coldsweat/mixin/CampfireWaterskinMixin.java) (and `coldsweatforge`) | Cooks and comes back warm, still salty |
| Kaleidoscope Stockpot | [StockpotBlockEntityMixin.java](../../../src/main/kaleidoscope/java/com/thirstwastaken2/kaleidoscope/mixin/StockpotBlockEntityMixin.java) | Cooks soup with it on purpose; the bucket comes back salty |
| Farm & Charm Timber Well | [TimberWellMixin.java](../../../src/main/farmandcharm/java/com/thirstwastaken2/farmandcharm/mixin/TimberWellMixin.java) | A well over sea water, on a beach or by the ocean, gives sea water |
| Kaleidoscope teapot as an item | [TeapotItemMixin.java](../../../src/main/kaleidoscope/java/com/thirstwastaken2/kaleidoscope/mixin/TeapotItemMixin.java) | Holds sea water and empties it back salty |

## Taken only if salty

| Mod | Where | What happens | Nodes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spelunkery | [AbstractCookingRecipeMixin.java](../../../src/main/spelunkery/java/com/thirstwastaken2/spelunkery/mixin/AbstractCookingRecipeMixin.java) | Its furnace recipe boils a sea water bucket into a salt bucket, and refuses every fresh bucket, which our purification takes instead. Nothing drinkable comes out | both 1.21.1 nodes |

## The hanging pot takes sea water

[HangingPotInteractions.java](../../../src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/block/HangingPotInteractions.java)
never asks whether the water is salty. A water bucket, a water bottle (`WaterPurity.isWaterContainer`),
a terracotta water bowl or a sneaking waterskin all pour in whatever quality they hold. The only pour
it refuses is where water evaporates, as in the Nether.

What happens next, in [HangingPotBlock.java](../../../src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/block/HangingPotBlock.java):

- **Mixing.** `withPoured` mixes with `WaterQuality.worse`, which returns `SALT` whenever either side is
  salty. One bottle of sea water turns a whole pot salty, Pure water included. That is the same rule as
  a cauldron and a waterskin.
- **Boiling.** `needsBoiling` is false for salt, so the pot never boils it and the boil counter is not
  set.
- **Drawing.** A bottle, bucket, bowl or waterskin drawn from it comes out salty.

So the pot works as storage for sea water, but never purifies it. A player who adds sea water to a
pot of Pure water loses the Pure water with no warning. If that should change, the place is
`HangingPotInteractions.use`: refuse the pour when `poured.salty()` and the pot holds fresh water, the
way a tank refuses a second grade.

Taking the salt out is distillation, which is on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and not built.
