/**
 * A {@code -javaagent} that ends an unattended NeoForge run once FML reports a loading failure.
 *
 * <p>{@code LoadingErrorScreenMixin} stops such a run from inside the game, but only when FML got as
 * far as applying mod mixins. A missing dependency fails earlier, in FML's mod sorting: no mod loads,
 * no mixin of this mod is applied, and the loading error screen waits on a button nobody is there to
 * press, holding the Gradle task open. What FML does write in every such case is
 * {@code crash-reports/crash-<time>-fml.txt}, and only for errors, never for warnings alone. This
 * agent, loaded by the JVM before FML and depending on nothing but the JDK, watches for a new one and
 * exits non-zero.
 *
 * <p>The loader script adds it only to {@code -Pagent} runs. Its argument is the crash report
 * directory; without one it is {@code crash-reports} in the working directory, the game directory.
