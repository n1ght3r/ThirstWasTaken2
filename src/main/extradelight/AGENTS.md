# src/main/extradelight — water grades in Extra Delight's kitchen

[Extra Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/extradelight) (mod id `extradelight`, package
`com.lance5057.extradelight`) is a Farmer's Delight addon with a Tap, Sinks, Jars, Kegs, a Vat, a Mixing
Bowl, a Chiller, a Melting Pot, an Evaporator and a Funnel. Its tanks keep fluid components, but every
bottle and bucket crossed into them as plain water, so a Dirty or salty bottle came back Clean; the Tap and
the Sink poured Clean water from nothing; sea water pickled, mixed lemonade and dried into salt as well as
fresh water did. This directory fixes that. The plan and its decisions are in
[docs/dev/integration/cooking/EXTRA-DELIGHT-INTEGRATION.md](../../../docs/dev/integration/cooking/EXTRA-DELIGHT-INTEGRATION.md).

**Built on `1.21.1-neoforge` only**, the mod's build 2.6.6, its only official one. What it does:

- **a tank keeps the grade** poured into it, by bottle or by bucket: the Jar, the Keg, and the fluid
  slots of the Vat, the Mixing Bowl and the Chiller. Two grades never share a tank: the tanks compare
  components, so a bottle of another grade is refused;
- **the Tap and the Sink give Murky water**, the grade every other mod's endless sink gives, by bottle,
  by bucket and through pipes. They stay endless;
- **a Funnel taking up a water source** grades it where it lay;
- **meltwater** (the Chiller's drip tray, ice in the Melting Pot) is rainwater, Clean by default;
- **sea water makes nothing** in the Vat or the Mixing Bowl, and crafts no Vinegar Pot or Yeast Pot;
- **the Evaporator dries only sea water**, into salt, over about eight minutes; fresh water stands in it untouched.

The drink and food values are not here. They are ids in `ThirstConfig`, common code that names no class
of the mod.

## How it works

- **Bottles.** Every bottle goes through `util/BottleFluidRegistry`. `getFluidFromBottle` hands out the
  first stack of a cached `SizedFluidIngredient`, so the mixin stamps a **copy**; stamping in place would
  stamp every later bottle. `getBottleFromFluid` stamps the bottle it returns with the fluid's grade,
  `defaultPurity` for water with none.
- **Buckets and other containers.** NeoForge's bucket wrapper takes and gives plain water. Rather than
  change it for every mod, `ExtraDelightWater.graded` marks the server thread as inside one of this mod's
  transfers (a `@WrapMethod` on each block's click handler), and only there `FluidUtilMixin` wraps the
  handler `FluidUtil.getFluidHandler(ItemStack)` returns in core's `WaterQualityFluidHandler`
  (`src/main/neoforge-fluidhandler`, shared with Sophisticated): water leaving a container carries its
  grade, and the container it turns into gets the grade of the water entering it. Every `FluidUtil`
  helper finds the container's handler through that method.
- **The fluid slots.** `IFancyTankHandler.fillInternal` and `drainInternal` are interface default
  methods, shared by the Vat, the Mixing Bowl and the Chiller, and ask the stack for its capability
  directly instead of through `FluidUtil`; the interface mixin wraps that call. The bucket branch of
  `drainInternal` builds a bucket from the fluid's type, so it is stamped with the grade the tank held at
  the start of the call.
- **The Tap and the Sink.** Their endless water is `WellFluidCapability(WATER)`, whose only users they
  are; `getFluid` and `drain(int)` hand it out Murky, and `drain(FluidStack)` goes through `drain(int)`.
  The glass bottle path builds `new FluidStack(WATER)` itself, so that argument is stamped Murky too.
- **Recipes.** The Vat, Mixing Bowl and Evaporator match water by fluid alone. Their `matches` mixins read
  the tank: sea water stops the first two, fresh water stops the Evaporator. The tank keeps what it holds.
- **Compiled against the mod.** The mixins name its classes, so `build.neoforge.gradle.kts` has it as
  `compileOnly`. Every injection point was checked against the 2.6.6 jar's bytecode.

## Not covered

- **`TapBlockEntity.fill` / `drain` and the Sink's**, two helpers nothing in 2.6.6 calls. A future caller
  would hand out Murky water (the capability) in a bucket with no grade.
- **The Juicer and the Mortar** fill only their own juices and pastes, never water.
- **Water saved in a tank before this integration** is unstamped and refuses stamped water until it is
  used up or drained, as in every tank; the Chiller's drip tray stops collecting meltwater until then.
- **The Forge 1.20.1 backport** (`extra-delight-unofficial-port`), by someone else, is not built against.
