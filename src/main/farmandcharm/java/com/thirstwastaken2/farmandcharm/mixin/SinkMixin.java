/**
 * The kitchen sink, which Farm & Charm 1.1.28 moved into Foundation, the library nested in its jar, and
 * which Candlelight registers as its kitchen sinks. Its tap fills it from nothing, and it handed out
 * plain water bottles and buckets, which read as Clean: an endless tap that made purifying pointless.
 * What it gives is now {@link StandingWater#STANDING}, Murky, as a trough's is. It stays an endless tap,
 * as its authors meant, but its water still wants boiling. Sea water poured in, from a bucket or a
 * bottle, is refused, since it would come out fresh.
