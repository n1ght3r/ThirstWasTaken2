/**
 * Sea water is not the water a Farm & Charm recipe asks for, as Brewin' and Chewin's keg, Cultural
 * Delights' vat and Fruits Delight make nothing from it. The recipes take {@code #c:water_bottles},
 * which holds the water bucket, matched by item alone, so a bucket of sea water made nettle tea.
 *
 * <p>Each block finds its recipe with a matcher of its own, testing each ingredient against each slot:
 * the Cooking Pot, the Stove (and Candlelight's, which extend it), the Crafting Bowl, and Candlelight's
 * Large Cooking Pot, named by string since Candlelight is not compiled against; the plugin skips it when
 * Candlelight is absent. Only water containers carry salt, so a salty stack matching nothing is the same
 * as sea water not matching water. Fresh water of any grade still matches: the pot and stove are heated,
 * and what they make is its own item, as tea is.
