# src/main/farmandcharm — water in Let's Do: Farm & Charm, and Candlelight's kitchen sinks

[Let's Do: Farm & Charm](https://modrinth.com/mod/lets-do-farm-charm) (mod id `farm_and_charm`, package
`net.satisfy.farm_and_charm`) has three blocks that hold water and three that cook with it. Its addon
[Let's Do: Candlelight](https://modrinth.com/mod/lets-do-candlelight-farmcharm-compat) (mod id
`candlelight`) has no water code of its own: its eleven kitchen sinks are Farm & Charm's `SinkBlock`, its
stoves extend Farm & Charm's, and its Large Cooking Pot runs Farm & Charm's recipes. So this one
directory serves both, gated on Farm & Charm, and Candlelight has no row in the integration table. The
plans and their decisions are
[docs/dev/integration/FARM-AND-CHARM-INTEGRATION.md](../../../docs/dev/integration/FARM-AND-CHARM-INTEGRATION.md)
and [CANDLELIGHT-INTEGRATION.md](../../../docs/dev/integration/CANDLELIGHT-INTEGRATION.md).

**Built on `1.21.1` and `1.21.1-neoforge`**, both mods' only builds for a version this mod supports
(Farm & Charm 1.1.26, Candlelight 2.1.13). Their 1.20.1 line is no longer updated and is not built
against. What it does:

- **Timber Well**: a bucket drawn from it carries the grade of the groundwater the well pumps, sampled
  where that source block lies, so a swamp well gives Dirty water and a beach well sea water. With no
  groundwater below, the well was filled by rain and gives `rainwaterPurity` (Clean by default); with
  rain collection off, the bucket is left unstamped.
- **Water Trough**: refuses a bucket of sea water, and what is drawn from it is Murky whatever went in.
- **Kitchen sink** (Candlelight): the same as the trough. It still fills from nothing, as its authors
  meant, but its water wants boiling.
- **Cooking Pot, Stove, Crafting Bowl** (Farm & Charm) **and Large Cooking Pot** (Candlelight): a salty
  stack matches no ingredient, so sea water cooks nothing. Fresh water of any grade still cooks; what
  comes out is its own item, as tea is.

The drink and food values are not here. They are ids in `ThirstConfig` (`farmAndCharmDrinks`,
`farmAndCharmFoods`, `candlelightFoods`), common code that names no class of either mod.

## How it works

- **One grade for standing water.** `StandingWater.STANDING` is Murky, and the trough and the sink share
  it so the two mods agree. Neither block can keep a grade (a level, a filled flag), so the grade is
  decided as the water comes out, from what the block is rather than what was poured in: nothing gets
  better by going through. Sea water is refused on the way in, since it would come out fresh.
- **The well samples on the draw.** `StandingWater.wellWater` scans the box `TimberWellBlock.hasGroundwater`
  scans, in its order, and hands the first source to `WaterPurity.sampleAt`. That is one sample per
  bucket, on the server, never on a tick, as `purity/AGENTS.md` asks. If rain and groundwater both
  filled it, the groundwater decides.
- **The recipes are matched per block.** None of the four goes through `GeneralUtil.matchesRecipe`: each
  has a private matcher (`matchesInventory`, `findBestMatchingSlot` and `countMatchingSlots`,
  `matchExact`) testing every ingredient against every slot. `SeaWaterIngredientMixin` wraps
  `Ingredient.test` in all of them. Only water containers carry salt, and `#c:water_bottles` holds only
  the water bucket, so a salty stack matching nothing is sea water not counting as water. Candlelight's
  stoves extend Farm & Charm's, so its stove target covers them.
- **Bottles and canteens are not accepted** by these recipes, as before: that is the tag Farm & Charm
  chose.

## Names on Fabric

The Fabric jars are in intermediary. `useItemOn` and every Minecraft call the mixins target are
remapped by Loom (`method_55765`, `Ingredient.test` as `method_8093`), which is why Farm & Charm is a
`modCompileOnly`. `SeaWaterIngredientMixin` says `remap = false` for the mods' own method names and
`remap = true` on its `@At`, and names Candlelight's pot by string, since Candlelight is not compiled
against. The plugin checks only the mods' own method names: `useItemOn` is a different name in each
loader's jar, so a block's mixin asks only that its class is there.

## How it stays optional

1. **Build.** Only where `deps.farm_and_charm` is set do the loader scripts add this directory and
   append the mixin config to the built manifest (on NeoForge with `farm_and_charm` as an optional
   dependency), from [its row in the integration table](../../../build-logic/src/main/kotlin/com/thirstwastaken2/buildlogic/Integrations.kt).
   Farm & Charm, Candlelight and Architectury API are on `runClient` only, so `runServer` and the
   gametests run without them. `-PwithoutOptional=farm-and-charm` leaves all three out;
   `-PwithoutOptional=candlelight` leaves Candlelight out and keeps Farm & Charm.
2. **Runtime gate.** `FarmAndCharmPresence` answers with resource lookups and class file reads, never
   loading a class, and names no class of either mod, no Minecraft class and no loader.
3. **Mixin plugin.** `shouldApplyMixin` asks the gate for each target, so without Candlelight the
   ingredient mixin applies to Farm & Charm's three blocks and skips the Large Cooking Pot.

## Checking it

- `checkOptionalSeam` finds the plugin and the gate loaded without the mods, and passes.
- `runGametest` passes unchanged: the mods are never on its classpath.
  `farmAndCharmDrinksAreMergedIntoAnOlderConfig` checks the config values of both.
- `./gradlew ":<node>:runClient" -Pagent=tools/agent/smoke/boot.jsonl -PwithoutOptional=farm-and-charm`
  comes up and stays up, and so does `-PwithoutOptional=candlelight`.
- What it does is checked in a real client with
  [tools/agent/integrations/farm-and-charm.jsonl](../../../tools/agent/integrations/farm-and-charm.jsonl),
  whose header says how to run and verify it.
