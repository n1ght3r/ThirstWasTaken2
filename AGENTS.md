# ThirstWasTaken2

A thirst mod for **Minecraft 26.3, 26.2, 26.1.x, 1.21.11 and 1.21.1** on **Fabric** and **NeoForge**: a
thirst bar, water purity and drinking. It began as a port of
[Thirst Was Taken](https://github.com/ghen-git/Thirst-Mod) (Forge, 1.19.2) and has diverged, so
upstream is a reference, not a spec. Its source is expected at `../Thirst-Mod` when comparing.

- Mod id and resource namespace: `thirstwastaken2`. Java package: `com.thirstwastaken2`.
- Published on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/thirst-was-taken-2) and
  [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thirst-was-taken-2).
- Every area below has its own `AGENTS.md`; read it before changing that area (see
  [Where to look](#where-to-look)).

## Build and run

One source tree, one jar per node. Nodes are the Gradle subprojects in `settings.gradle.kts`:
`26.3.x`, `26.2.x`, `26.1.x`, `1.21.11`, `1.21.1` on Fabric, and the same five with `-neoforge`
(`build.neoforge.gradle.kts`). The Fabric `1.21.1` jar also covers 1.21; the NeoForge one does not.
1.20.1 is `1.20.1` on Fabric and `1.20.1-forge` on MinecraftForge 47 (`build.forge.gradle.kts`, whose
shipped jar is the SRG-remapped `reobfJar`); see [docs/dev/VERSION-1.20.1.md](docs/dev/VERSION-1.20.1.md).

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./gradlew buildAndCollect` | Build every node, jars in `build/libs/` |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:build"` | Build one node |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:runServer"` | Fastest smoke test: applies every mixin, loads registries, idles. Clean run prints `ThirstWasTaken2 initialized for Minecraft <version>` |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:runClient"` | Dev client |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:runGametest"` | Automated in-game tests, headless, seconds. **The check that proves behaviour.** CI runs it on every node. See [src/gametest/java/AGENTS.md](src/gametest/java/AGENTS.md) |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:runDatagen"` | Regenerate recipes, advancements, tags, damage type and models into `src/main/generated/<mc version>/` (Fabric nodes only) |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:checkDatagen"` | Fails if generated output differs from what is committed. CI runs it |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:runBenchmark"` | Server cost in time and memory. See [benchmark/AGENTS.md](src/dev/java/com/thirstwastaken2/dev/benchmark/AGENTS.md) |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:runServer" -Pagent=<file>.jsonl` | Script a running game and read numbers back. See [agent/AGENTS.md](src/dev/java/com/thirstwastaken2/dev/agent/AGENTS.md) |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:runClient" -Pagent=tools/agent/smoke/boot.jsonl -PwithoutOptional=<name,...>\|all` | A dev client without those optional mods comes up and stays up. The check 1.0.9 lacked |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:checkOptionalSeam"` | Fails when a class loaded without an optional mod names that mod. CI runs it |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:checkLang"` | Fails when one of the nine lang files lacks a key `en_us` has, or has one it lacks. CI runs it |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:checkDataConditions"` | Fails when a shipped data file names another mod's id without a `mod_loaded` condition for it. CI runs it |
| `./gradlew ":<node>:checkApiSurface"` | Fails when a public signature in `com.thirstwastaken2.api` names an internal type. CI runs it |
| `python tools/release/publish.py --dry-run` | Release to Modrinth, then `publish_curseforge.py --no-build`. Checklist and flags in the scripts' docstrings |

- **Never hand-edit `src/main/generated/`.** Change the generator in `src/datagen`. NeoForge nodes
  reuse the Fabric output and translate its keys; `checkNeoForgeResources` fails if one survives.
- Each node runs in its own `run/<node>/` (worlds are not portable across versions). A new one needs
  its own `eula.txt`.
- Unqualified `./gradlew build` acts on the **active** node (`26.3.x`). `./gradlew "Set active project
  to <node>"` rewrites the versioned comments in `src/` for the IDE. **Run
  `./gradlew "Reset active project"` before committing.**
- The first run needs network for `maven.modrinth`; after that `--offline` works.

## Stack and constraints

- **Java**: 26.1+ runs on Java 25, 1.21.x on Java 21. Anything a 1.20.1 node will compile (core, the
  Fabric loader directories, datagen, gametests, dev tools) uses nothing newer than Java 17: no pattern
  `switch`, no `Math.clamp`, no `getFirst`. Integration directories no 1.20.1 node builds may use Java 21.
  See [docs/dev/VERSION-1.20.1.md](docs/dev/VERSION-1.20.1.md).
- **Multi-version via [Stonecutter](https://stonecutter.kikugie.dev)**. Per-node values (dependency
  versions, compat ranges) live only in `stonecutter.properties.toml`; there is no version catalog.
  `stonecutter.gradle.kts` is the controller, `build.gradle.kts` is the Fabric script (Loom),
  `build.neoforge.gradle.kts` the NeoForge one (ModDevGradle), `build.forge.gradle.kts` the Forge one
  (ModDevGradle Legacy), `gradle/shared.gradle.kts` the tasks all three share. `build-logic` is an included build of plain Kotlin both scripts call: the integration table,
  `-PwithoutOptional`, the JFR arguments. It is data and pure functions only and never depends on Loom,
  ModDevGradle or Stonecutter; the loader scripts make every `sourceSets`, `loom` and `neoForge` call
  themselves. `./gradlew -p build-logic test` runs its tests.
- **Split source sets.** Anything touching `net.minecraft.client` goes in `src/client/java`, never
  `src/main/java`. NeoForge compiles both together, so only the Fabric nodes catch a mistake.
- **Common code never names a mod loader.** `src/main/java` and `src/client/java` call
  `platform/Loader` and `client/platform/ClientLoader`, one copy per loader in `src/*/<loader>`.
  `checkLoaderSeam` enforces it. See [platform/AGENTS.md](src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/platform/AGENTS.md).
- **Optional integrations are soft.** No hard dependency, ever. Gate on `Loader.isModLoaded` (plus a
  marker-class probe when extending a foreign class) and keep integration classes off the load path.
  Asking the gate is not enough on its own: the JVM verifies a class whole before any of it runs, so
  an entrypoint, a `@Mod` class, a Jade plugin or a mixin plugin names no type of that mod anywhere,
  lambdas included, and hands over through a static call into another class. `checkOptionalSeam`
  enforces it; 1.0.9 crashed every NeoForge client without Sophisticated Core for want of it.
- **Mixins**: in `com.thirstwastaken2.mixin`, package-private, `abstract`, every injected member
  prefixed `thirst$`, listed in `thirstwastaken2.mixins.json` or they silently do nothing. Client,
  Fabric-client, dev, Create, Create Fly, Sophisticated, Supplementaries, Kaleidoscope Cookery, Brewin' and Chewin', Cold Sweat, Cultural Delights, Fruits Delight and Expanded Delight mixins
  have their own configs next to their sources. A new core config goes in both loader manifests; an
  integration's goes in its row of the integration table.
- **Player state** is the immutable record `ThirstData`. Derive a new one and write through
  `ThirstManager.set` only when it changed; every write is a sync packet.
- **Config** is the Gson POJO `ThirstConfig`. A new field: add it, clamp it in `sanitize()`, and if
  user-facing add a widget and reset line in `client/config/ConfigCategory`, in the page and tab of its
  topic, plus lang keys in all nine lang files (`checkLang` fails otherwise). Pages and tabs are cut by
  topic, not by length; see "Grouping settings" in [client/AGENTS.md](src/client/java/com/thirstwastaken2/client/AGENTS.md).
- **`com.thirstwastaken2.api` is public API** for other mods: `ThirstApi`, `ThirstEvents`. A signature
  there changes only after a deprecation, its public signatures name only Minecraft, JDK and `api` types
  (`checkApiSurface`), and it holds no `//?`. An addition bumps `ThirstApi.API_VERSION`. See
  [docs/docs/developers/](docs/docs/developers/java-api.md).
- **Per-item lookups are cached** by `Item` identity (`ThirstApi.CACHE`, `WaterPurity.INFO`). No
  string building or regex on a per-call path; tooltips call these every frame.
- **`ThirstWasTaken2.DEV`** is true under Loom run tasks, false in the published jar. Dev-only tooling
  lives in the `dev` source set, which `main` and `client` never reference.
- Intentional divergence from upstream gets a comment at the divergence.

## Supporting several Minecraft versions

Version differences live in two places only:

- **`platform/`**: `Vanilla` (common) and `ClientVanilla` (client) wrap every vanilla call whose shape
  changed, with one signature on every version.
- **`mixin/`**: an `@Inject` signature tracks its target, so a mixin may fork. Its body stays one line.

Everything else must compile unchanged on every version; `checkVersionSeam` fails CI otherwise. A
branch is a Stonecutter comment, the disabled side commented out:

```java
//? if >=26.2 {
return minecraft.gui.hud.isHidden();
//?} else {
/*return minecraft.options.hideGui;
*///?}
```

A pure rename needs no branch: add it to `replacements` in `stonecutter.gradle.kts`.

- **Replacements do not chain.** Each applies to the original text. When two differences meet, give
  each result a rule of its own (see `critereon` in `stonecutter.gradle.kts`).
- **Replacements run backwards too**, on every node whose condition is false and on "Reset active
  project". What a rule writes must be the same on every node it covers and must not occur in the
  sources for any other reason; the comment above `replacements` in `stonecutter.gradle.kts` says how.
- **No block comments inside a `//?` block.** The disabled branch is itself one `/* */`. Put Javadoc
  outside or use line comments.
- **A one-line branch** (`//?} else` with no brace) is disabled as `//line`, not `/*line*/`; that is
  the form Stonecutter writes back.
- **Set and Reset active project must round-trip**: after `"Set active project to <node>"` then
  `"Reset active project"`, `git diff` shows nothing new under `src/`.

Every difference between versions is listed in [docs/dev/VERSION-DIFFERENCES.md](docs/dev/VERSION-DIFFERENCES.md).

### Version policy

- No fixed limit on Minecraft versions or loaders, and adding one does not retire another. Every
  node still costs a CI job and a fork in `platform/` wherever vanilla differs, so a node is
  retired only when it is no longer worth that.
- 1.21.1 is kept for modpacks. If a feature needs a core-code fork for it, retire 1.21.1 instead.

### Adding a Minecraft version

1. Add `<version>` and `<version>-neoforge` in `settings.gradle.kts`, and three tables in
   `stonecutter.properties.toml`: `["<version>"]` (shared), `[fabric."<version>"]`,
   `[neoforge."<version>"]`. A key lives in exactly one table a node reads. AppleSkin is pinned by
   Modrinth version id, since its Fabric and NeoForge uploads share a version number.
2. CI needs nothing: `.github/workflows/build.yml` makes one job per loader table.
3. `./gradlew ":<version>:build"` and fix errors by extending `platform/`, not by branching at the call site.
4. Smoke-test with `runServer`.

### Dependency updates

Dependabot covers Gradle plugins, the wrapper, Actions and `docs/`, but not
`stonecutter.properties.toml`. `.github/scripts/update_mc_deps.py` does that daily through
`.github/workflows/update-mc-deps.yml`, into the `automation/minecraft-deps` PR. Test with `--dry-run`.
A new dependency must be added to `MODRINTH_DEPS` in the script.

## Architecture

`ThirstWasTaken2.initialize` is the one loader-independent entry point, called by
`ThirstWasTaken2Fabric` and `ThirstWasTaken2NeoForge`. It loads config, registers player data, blocks,
components, items and loot, then hooks server tick, block/item use, commands and tag reload through
`Loader`. Init order, the drain chain and the invariants are in
[src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/AGENTS.md](src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/AGENTS.md).

Water is `WaterQuality`, sealed: `Fresh(grade 0-3)` or `Salt`. It is sampled from the world only when
water is collected, drunk or looked at with Jade, never on a tick or tooltip path. See
[purity/AGENTS.md](src/main/java/com/thirstwastaken2/purity/AGENTS.md).

| Serene Seasons | `deps.serene_seasons`: every node, every loader | [src/main/sereneseasons/AGENTS.md](src/main/sereneseasons/AGENTS.md) |

### Adding an integration

1. Add a row to [the integration table](build-logic/src/main/kotlin/com/thirstwastaken2/buildlogic/Integrations.kt): its directory, deps key,
   loaders, and what the manifest names. Both loader scripts wire its directories and patch the built
   manifest from that row; neither needs a block of its own unless the mod needs something the row
   cannot say.
2. Add the deps key to the nodes that build it in `stonecutter.properties.toml`, and the mod to
   `MODRINTH_DEPS` in `.github/scripts/update_mc_deps.py`.
3. Add its `compileOnly` and `runClientMod` lines to the loader scripts it builds on.
4. Put its version differences in `com.thirstwastaken2.<integration>.platform`, or in core
   `platform/Vanilla` when the difference is vanilla's. `checkVersionSeam` fails on a `//?` anywhere else.
5. Gate it at runtime and keep it off the load path. `checkOptionalSeam` checks that, and that core
   code never names its package, which it reads from the table. An integration both loaders compile that has to run
   code at init can carry neither `@Mod` nor `ModInitializer`: make it a `Runnable` marked
   `platform/IntegrationEntrypoint` and list it under `thirstwastaken2:integration` in its row's
   `fabricEntrypoints` (Serene Seasons does).
