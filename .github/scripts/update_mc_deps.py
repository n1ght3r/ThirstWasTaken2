"""Bumps the Minecraft-bound dependency versions in stonecutter.properties.toml.

Dependabot cannot do this. The versions live in a Stonecutter properties file it does not read, and
even if it did, it would offer every version node the newest Fabric API, the one built for the newest
Minecraft. This asks Modrinth instead, once per node, for the newest upload of each mod that is built
for that node's loader and lists the Minecraft version that node compiles against, and writes it back in
place, comments and layout untouched.

    python .github/scripts/update_mc_deps.py            # rewrite the file
    python .github/scripts/update_mc_deps.py --dry-run  # only report
    python .github/scripts/update_mc_deps.py --summary build/deps-summary.md
    python .github/scripts/update_mc_deps.py --check    # only report where the docs disagree

Rules:
- A node compiles against the Minecraft version settings.gradle.kts gives it (`26.1.x` -> `26.1.2`),
  so that is the version a candidate has to list. A newer Minecraft patch is a manual bump.
- A node takes the uploads of the loader its name ends in (`26.2.x-neoforge`, NeoForge; `1.20.1-forge`,
  Forge); a node with no loader in its name takes Fabric ones. `tools/node_names.py` reads the name.
  Each node's values are read and rewritten in its loader table, `[fabric."26.2.x"]`,
  `[neoforge."26.2.x"]` or `[forge."1.20.1"]`, or else in the shared `["26.2.x"]` table.
- The loaders are never bumped. `deps.fabric_loader`, `deps.neoforge` and `deps.forge` are what the
  build compiles and tests against, and the first two are also the lower bound the manifests write, so
  a bump would make every player update their loader along with the mod. Large packs update loaders
  last, and players asked. What this script moves is `deps.*_latest` beside each, which nothing else
  reads, and the pull request prints the loader's changelog from the minimum up to it. A person raises
  a minimum by copying its `_latest` over it, when an integration or a fix needs a newer loader.
- NeoForge comes from maven.neoforged.net: the newest build for the same Minecraft version as the
  tracked one, releases only unless that build is a beta.
- Forge comes from maven.minecraftforge.net's promotions: the build it promotes as latest for the node's
  Minecraft version. mods.toml asks for Forge 47 or later in any case, as Forge's own template does.
- MixinExtras, which only the Forge nodes nest in their jar, comes from Maven Central, releases only.
- Only release uploads are taken, unless the pinned version is itself a beta or alpha: a node on a
  pre-release dependency stays on that channel until a release catches up.
- A candidate has to be published after the pinned version. Nothing is ever downgraded.
- Fabric Loader is one global value and comes from Fabric's meta API, stable builds only.
- Loom is left alone: a Loom bump tends to need a Gradle bump alongside it.
- README.md, docs/docs/installation.md and docs/dev/VERSION-DIFFERENCES.md print the same versions for
  people to read, so a bump rewrites them too, and only there: CHANGELOG.md says what a past release was
  built against and has to keep saying it. All three print Fabric API and NeoForge; the first two print
  Fabric Loader; only the installation page prints the optional mods, in one table per loader.
  An integration's own page under docs/dev/integration may print its pins too, ids included, as the
  Kaleidoscope Cookery one does; a dependency lists every such page in `mirrors` (Fabric nodes) and
  `neoforge_mirrors` (NeoForge and Forge nodes), and a bump rewrites the number and, when pinned by id,
  the id. Pages that say what a version was written or tested against (`Written on ... from ...`,
  manual test logs) are records like CHANGELOG.md and stay out of those lists.
- The pull request lists the other tracked files that still name an old version, for a person to
  judge, except those in `RECORDS`, whose every mention is a record and is meant to stay.
- The pull request prints the changelog of every Modrinth upload a bump moves past, skipped ones too,
  each text once per mod, and marks those naming water, drinks or the blocks an integration hooks, so
  a person can tell whether an integration needs to follow. The loaders' changelogs come from their own
  places: NeoForge's and Forge's from the changelog file Maven keeps beside each build, which lists
  every build of its line, and Fabric Loader's from its GitHub releases.
- `--check` goes the other way: it reports a version the properties file pins that those pages do
  not name, which is what a bump made by hand leaves behind. It reads the properties file and those
  pages and nothing else, so it needs no network and gates a pull request in well under a second. What lets it work
  offline is that an id-pinned version carries its number in a comment above it, so `--check` also
  fails when one of those comments is missing, on every node rather than only the Fabric ones.

Standard library only, so CI needs nothing but a Python interpreter.
